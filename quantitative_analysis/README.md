# Quantitative Analysis

## Overview
This directory contains all quantitative research materials including survey data, analysis scripts, and statistical reports for the generative AI research project.

## Directory Structure

### `survey_data/`
Contains all survey-related materials:

#### `questionnaires/`
- Original survey questionnaires
- Different versions (pilot, revised, final)
- Include both digital and paper versions
- Translation files if applicable

#### `responses/`
- Raw survey response data
- Export files from survey platforms (Qualtrics, SurveyMonkey, etc.)
- Include timestamps and metadata
- Backup files and data validation reports

#### `processed_data/`
- Cleaned and processed survey data
- Coded responses and derived variables
- Data quality reports
- Final analysis-ready datasets

### `analysis_scripts/`
- Python/R/SPSS scripts for data analysis
- Data cleaning and preprocessing scripts
- Statistical analysis code
- Visualization scripts
- Include comments and documentation

### `reports/`
- Statistical analysis reports
- Survey methodology documentation
- Data quality assessments
- Preliminary findings reports

### `visualizations/`
- Charts, graphs, and infographics
- Interactive dashboards
- Presentation-ready figures
- Include both raw and formatted versions

### `raw_data/`
- Original data files before processing
- Backup copies of all data
- Data dictionaries and codebooks
- Metadata and documentation

## Data Management Guidelines

### File Naming
- Use consistent naming: `YYYY-MM-DD_Description_Type.ext`
- Include version numbers for scripts: `analysis_v1.2.py`
- Use descriptive names for datasets: `survey_responses_cleaned_v2.csv`

### Data Security
- All personal data must be anonymized
- Use secure storage for sensitive information
- Maintain data access logs
- Follow institutional data protection policies

### Version Control
- Track changes to analysis scripts
- Document data processing steps
- Maintain audit trail of all modifications
- Use Git for code versioning

## Analysis Workflow

1. **Data Collection**
   - Survey deployment and monitoring
   - Response tracking and quality checks
   - Data export and backup

2. **Data Cleaning**
   - Remove incomplete responses
   - Handle missing data
   - Validate data integrity
   - Create derived variables

3. **Statistical Analysis**
   - Descriptive statistics
   - Inferential analysis
   - Hypothesis testing
   - Effect size calculations

4. **Visualization**
   - Create charts and graphs
   - Develop interactive dashboards
   - Prepare presentation materials

5. **Reporting**
   - Document findings
   - Interpret results
   - Prepare final reports

## Key Variables to Track
- [ ] Demographics (age, gender, education, occupation)
- [ ] AI tool usage patterns
- [ ] Perceived benefits and challenges
- [ ] Trust and confidence levels
- [ ] Impact on productivity and creativity
- [ ] Ethical concerns and considerations

## Software and Tools
- **Statistical Analysis**: R, Python (pandas, scipy), SPSS
- **Survey Platform**: [Specify platform used]
- **Visualization**: matplotlib, seaborn, ggplot2, Tableau
- **Documentation**: Jupyter notebooks, R Markdown
