## Interview Management

### Participant Information
- Maintain secure participant database
- Track consent status and data usage permissions
- Document recruitment and selection process
- Include demographic information (anonymized)

### Interview Process
- Schedule and conduct interviews
- Record audio/video (with consent)
- Take detailed notes during interviews
- Follow up on unclear responses

### Transcription Process
1. **Audio Processing**: Convert recordings to text
2. **Quality Check**: Review for accuracy and completeness
3. **Anonymization**: Remove identifying information
4. **Formatting**: Standardize structure and layout
5. **Validation**: Cross-check with original recordings

## Analysis Framework

### Thematic Analysis Approach
1. **Familiarization**: Read and re-read transcripts
2. **Initial Coding**: Identify key concepts and themes
3. **Theme Development**: Group codes into themes
4. **Review**: Check themes against data
5. **Define and Name**: Finalize theme definitions
6. **Report**: Write up findings with examples

### Coding Guidelines
- Use consistent coding terminology
- Document coding decisions and rationale
- Include negative cases and exceptions
- Maintain inter-coder reliability checks

### Quality Assurance
- Member checking with participants
- Peer debriefing sessions
- Triangulation with quantitative data
- Reflexivity and positionality notes

## Key Themes to Explore
